You don‚Äôt pass it to a function yourself. Instead, JavaScript itself passes it, depending on ",["$","em",null,{"children":"how you call"}]," the function. For example, calls using the dot ",["$","code",null,{"children":"."}]," notation ‚Äî like ",["$","code",null,{"children":"iceCream.eat()"}]," ‚Äî will get a special ",["$","code",null,{"children":"this"}]," value from whatever is before the ",["$","code",null,{"children":"."}]," (in our example, ",["$","code",null,{"children":"iceCream"}],"). The value of ",["$","code",null,{"children":"this"}]," inside a function depends on how the function is ",["$","em",null,{"children":"called"}],", not where it‚Äôs defined. Helpers like ",["$","code",null,{"children":".bind"}],", ",["$","code",null,{"children":".call"}],", and ",["$","code",null,{"children":".apply"}]," let you have for more control over the value of ",["$","code",null,{"children":"this"}],"."]}],"\n",["$","li",null,{"children":[["$","strong",null,{"children":"Arrow Functions"}],": Arrow functions are similar to function expressions. You declare them like this: ",["$","code",null,{"children":"let sayHi = () => { }"}],". They‚Äôre concise and are often used for one-liners. Arrow functions are ",["$","em",null,{"children":"more limited"}]," than regular functions ‚Äî for example, they have no concept of ",["$","code",null,{"children":"this"}]," whatsoever. When you write ",["$","code",null,{"children":"this"}]," inside of an arrow function, it uses ",["$","code",null,{"children":"this"}]," of the closest ‚Äúregular‚Äù function above. This is similar to what would happen if you used an argument or a variable that only exists in a function above. Practically, this means that people use arrow functions when they want to ‚Äúsee‚Äù the same ",["$","code",null,{"children":"this"}]," inside of them as in the code surrounding them."]}],"\n",["$","li",null,{"children":[["$","strong",null,{"children":"Function Binding"}],": Usually, ",["$","em",null,{"children":"binding"}]," a function ",["$","code",null,{"children":"f"}]," to a particular ",["$","code",null,{"children":"this"}]," value and arguments means creating a ",["$","em",null,{"children":"new"}]," function that calls ",["$","code",null,{"children":"f"}]," with those predefined values. JavaScript has a built-in helper to do it called ",["$","code",null,{"children":".bind"}],", but you could also do it by hand. Binding was a popular way to make nested functions ‚Äúsee‚Äù the same value of ",["$","code",null,{"children":"this"}]," as the outer functions. But now this use case is handled by arrow functions, so binding is not used as often."]}],"\n",["$","li",null,{"children":[["$","strong",null,{"children":"Call Stack"}],": Calling a function is like entering a room. Every time we call a function, the variables inside of it are initialized all over again.

When we return from the function, that ‚Äúroom‚Äù disappears with all its variables. You can visualize these rooms as a vertical stack of rooms ‚Äî a ",["$","em",null,{"children":"call stack"}],".

This is useful for when you want to repeat the thing you just did in your function ",["$","em",null,{"children":"again"}],", but for different arguments. For example, if you‚Äôre writing a search engine that crawls the web, your ",["$","code",null,{"children":"collectLinks(url)"}]," function might first collect the links from a page, and then ",["$","em",null,{"children":"call itself"}]," for every ",["$","em",null,{"children":"link"}]," until it visits all pages. The pitfall with recursion is that it‚Äôs easy to write code that never finishes because a function keeps calling itself forever. If this happens, JavaScript will stop it with an error called ‚Äústack overflow‚Äù. It‚Äôs called this way because it means we have too many function calls stacked in our call stack, and it has literally overflown."]}],"\n",["$","li",null,{"children":[["$","strong",null,{"children":"Higher-Order Function"}],": A higher-order function is a function that deals with other functions by taking them as arguments or returning them.

You‚Äôre expecting a ‚Äúcall back‚Äù. For example, ",["$","code",null,{"children":"setTimeout"}]," takes a ",["$","em",null,{"children":"callback"}]," function and‚Ä¶ calls you back after a timeout.

Then the inner function could still be called later, and read the variables of the ",["$","em",null,{"children":"outer"}]," function. In practice, this is very useful! But for this to work, the outer function‚Äôs variables need to ‚Äústick around‚Äù somewhere. So in this case, JavaScript takes care of ‚Äúkeeping the variables alive‚Äù instead of ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù them as it would usually do. This is called a ‚Äúclosure‚Äù.
